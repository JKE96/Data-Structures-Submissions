2.The alternate functions are used to indicate whether the UART is sending or receiving data.
3.The baud rate is the speed that the input and output have for internal clocks.

5. If there is a problem with the hardware the Salae Logic Analyzer can see exactly which bits are making it through the SM32 board.
