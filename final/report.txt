Jarod England and Steven Russell

I was responsible for making certain parts of the game such as the coins, playr, menu, points system, and transition page.
Steven contributed a lot to the project we both did a lot.

SOme technical challenges include the SD card audio which was a huge pain because the email that I received from an AI did not give the correct SOX command which confused me.

I would change some of the structures and functions for better use.
