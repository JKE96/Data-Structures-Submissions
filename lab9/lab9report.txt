Q1. We are making the functions that create macros that set the CS pin high and low.

Q2. Using a timer over a delay loop lets the processor not completely stop processing and do other things when using a timer instead of a delay loop.

Q3. DMA is important for improving the performance of the display application becuase it helps 

Q4. ms. In a FAT file system, the first
several storage blocks are used to maintain data about the file system – for
example allocation tables – while the remaining blocks are used to store the
contents of files and directories.The file allocation table

Q5.FAT32 is more efficient while The data on an SD card is organized as a file system – cards below 2GB
are typically formatted as FAT16 file systems. In a FAT file system, the first
several storage blocks are used to maintain data about the file system – for
example allocation tables – while the remaining blocks are used to store the
contents of files and directories. Overall, the cluster size is different.

Difficulties: The code did not work that was given to us or we initialized something incorrectly and we wasted a lot of time trying to fix what was wrong but it never really worked in the end.

What I learned: We learned how to convert image files to bmp files and how to initialize SD card pins.
